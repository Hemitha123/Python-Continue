1.Python is called dynamic typing language because it has 
predefined variables.

2.Python data types are classified into 2 types: 
   *Simple data type
   *Complex data type

3.List is collection of heterogeneous data and are mutable 
that is we can change the data.
  Tuple is also collection of heterogeneous data and are 
immutable that is we cannot change the data.

4.For loop-it keep repeating the instruction for give specific
time.
  While loop-it keep repeating the instructions until the give
condition satisfied.

5.Function is a set of instruction used to do the task.
6.Function have 2 types:
   *User defined functions
   *liberary functions

7.List Comprehension is used to write the instructions in single 
line making it shorter using the formate where the output is 
given first and and the instruction after the output.

8.We can reverse a given number by using indexing and also by 
using reverse function, the steps is using indexing x[::-1] 
  using function is name.reverse()

9.In positional argument the order of the parameter should be
in the same order but in the keyword argument even if we 
change the order of the parament it accepts since we give the 
name for that parameter and it accepts according to it.

10.Zip() is used to combine two or more list and make a single
list.
